# Finance & Accounting Advisory: What It Is, When You Need It, and What “Good” Looks Like

Growth Operators partners with middle-market businesses and private equity-owned companies to strengthen finance and accounting capabilities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## TL;DR
Finance & Accounting Advisory is how companies upgrade the *operating system* of finance—so leaders get reliable numbers, faster close cycles, clearer forecasts, and decision support that scales.

---

## 1) What “Finance & Accounting Advisory” actually means
It’s practical, operator-minded support that strengthens:
- **Accounting fundamentals** (controls, close, policies, reconciliations)
- **Financial reporting** (monthly packs, KPIs, board-ready reporting)
- **Forecasting & planning** (budgets, rolling forecasts, scenario models)
- **Cash & working capital visibility** (cash cadence, AR/AP hygiene, runway)
- **Decision support** (unit economics, pricing/margin analysis, “what-if” models)

It’s not just “better spreadsheets”—it’s a system that produces *trusted* inputs for leadership decisions.

## 2) 10 signs you need Finance & Accounting Advisory
1. Close takes **too long** and still produces surprises  
2. Leadership debates the **accuracy** of numbers  
3. Forecasts are “best guesses” and rarely match reality  
4. KPIs vary by department or are defined inconsistently  
5. Cash feels tight, but no one can explain *why* quickly  
6. Audit, lender, or investor requests cause fire drills  
7. Margin is unclear at the product/customer/channel level  
8. New systems (ERP, billing, payroll) aren’t stitched together cleanly  
9. You’re growing fast but finance can’t keep up with complexity  
10. You’re prepping for a transaction, refinance, or diligence event

## 4) Typical workstreams (a menu you can mix and match)
- Close process stabilization (calendar, checklists, ownership)
- Chart of accounts cleanup / reporting structure
- Policies & controls (approval workflows, segregation of duties)
- KPI pack / operating dashboard build-out

## 5) Who this is for

## 6) How to choose the right advisory approach (quick decision guide)
**If you need speed + leadership:** consider **fractional/interim** support to lead the work. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
**If you need a clear roadmap:** run a diagnostic and prioritize the 3–5 changes that unlock momentum.  
**If you’re transaction-bound:** align reporting, QoE readiness, and diligence expectations early.

## 7) FAQs
**Is this just accounting clean-up?**  
No—accounting quality is the foundation, but the goal is decision support and scalable finance.

**Do you replace my team?**  
Advisory strengthens systems and capability; fractional/interim support can fill leadership gaps when needed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**How long does this take?**  
Often staged: stabilize close + reporting first, then forecasting, then optimization.
