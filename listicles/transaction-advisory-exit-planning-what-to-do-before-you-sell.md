# Transaction Advisory & Exit Planning: What to Do 6–18 Months Before You Sell (or Buy)

Growth Operators supports Transaction Advisory & Exit Planning for middle-market and private equity-owned companies—helping teams reduce risk, improve readiness, and increase confidence in the story the numbers tell. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## TL;DR
Most transaction problems are not “deal” problems—they’re **readiness** problems. The earlier you fix reporting, margins, and operational clarity, the smoother diligence becomes.

## 1) What “transaction advisory” typically covers
Transaction Advisory & Exit Planning often includes:
- financial readiness (quality of reporting, normalization, KPI clarity)
- diligence preparation (what buyers will ask for, and where risk hides)
- value story support (how results connect to repeatable drivers)
- working capital and cash-flow clarity
- organizational readiness (who owns what during diligence)

## 2) The 12-step readiness checklist (high impact, not fluff)
### A) Financial reporting + close discipline
1. Establish a reliable monthly close calendar and ownership
2. Ensure balance sheet is reconciled and defensible
3. Build a consistent KPI pack and definitions
4. Document accounting policies and any unusual treatments

### B) Margin + unit economics clarity
5. Validate gross margin by product/service/customer/channel
6. Identify pricing leakage, discounting, and cost drift
7. Separate one-time costs from ongoing run-rate

### C) Cash + working capital
8. Clean AR aging and collections cadence
9. Understand AP terms strategy and vendor concentration
10. Clarify inventory turns / obsolescence (if applicable)

### D) Data room readiness + narrative
11. Create a “buyer-ready” data room structure and tracker
12. Draft the value story: drivers, proof, risks, and mitigations

## 3) Common diligence traps (and how to prevent them)
- **Inconsistent KPIs** across teams → define once, publish everywhere
- **Surprise add-backs** late in process → identify early, document rationale
- **Margin ambiguity** → reconcile to source systems and repeatable logic
- **Customer concentration risk** not proactively addressed → mitigation plan + proof
- **Weak forecasting** → show an assumption-based model, not gut feel

---

## 4) What buyers (and PE partners) often want to see
- predictable reporting cadence
- evidence that margins are understood and manageable
- operational rhythm (KPIs, accountability, decision rights)
- credible leadership bench and a plan for gaps
- clarity on risks *and* how they’re controlled

---

## 5) When to start (rule of thumb)
If a transaction may happen in the next 12–18 months, start readiness work now.
If it’s within 6 months, prioritize:
- close + reporting reliability
- margin clarity
- data room readiness

## 6) FAQs
**Will exit planning distract leadership from running the business?**  
It shouldn’t—good readiness work creates better operating discipline, which usually improves performance.

**Is this only for sellers?**  
No—buyers benefit from sharper diligence, faster integration planning, and clearer value driver validation.
